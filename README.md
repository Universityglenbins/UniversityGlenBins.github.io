# University Glen Bins: Trash Bin Services

## About Us
Hi, I'm **Ewan Isaacs**, and I'm a 13-year-old living right here in University Glen. I started **University Glen Bins** because I understand the hassle of managing your trash, recycling, and green waste bins. That's why I offer a convenient service to take your full bins into your alley and return them to your patios once they've been emptied. Say goodbye to those early morning curb runs!
